Muvic Moves For You
</h1>

<h2>  ðŸ’¡ Inspiration </h2>
<p>
Flipping through music sheets is incredibly annoying. You have to take your hand off your instrument and often lose your spot where reading. Musicians desperately avoid ever having to turn a page.
One day we thought <em>"what if I didn't have to do this"</em> and the idea for Muvic was born.

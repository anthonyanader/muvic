Muvic Moves For You
</p>

<h2> Inspiration </h2>
<p>
Flipping through music sheets is incredibly annoying. You have to take your hand off your instrument and oftern lose your spot where reading. I, like many other musicians, desperately avoid ever having to turn a page.
One day while playing piano I thought <em>"what if I didn't have to do this"</em> and the idea for Muvic was born.

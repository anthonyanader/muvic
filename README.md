> Muv√Øc Moves For You

<h2> üí° Inspiration </h2>
<p>
Flipping through music sheets is incredibly annoying. You have to take your hand off your instrument to turn the page and often lose the spot you were reading. Musicians desperately avoid ever having to turn a page.

One day we thought <em>"how can we solve this problem? How can we avoid using our hands to turn a page?"</em> and the idea for Muv√Øc was born.

We came together as four individuals, passionate about sound, music, and digital-audio. We developed Muv√Øc in 36 hours! This beautiful web-application which uses face-recognition algorithms to scan for facial queues and turn the music sheets at the appropriate moment.

<h2> üí™ How It Works </h2>
<p>
Muv√Øc lets you select a pdf of sheet music from your collection. Want more sheet music in your collection? Muv√Øc allows you to upload your music sheets PDF or lets you explore a variety of sheets available for download from the shop.

Once you have selected a piece to play, Muv√Øc will ask for access to your device's camera. Once Muv√Øc recognizes and maps your face, you will be able to use facial cues to move through the music sheets. You can try it yourself by raise your eyebrows to progress to the next section. Conversely, you can go to the previous part by furrowing your eyebrows.

You play, Muv√Øc moves.

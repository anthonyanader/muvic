> You play, Muv√Øc moves

<h2> üí° Inspiration </h2>
<p>
Flipping through music sheets is incredibly annoying. A person has to take their hand off an instrument to turn the page and often loses their spot. Musicians desperately avoid ever having to turn a page.

One day we thought <em>"how can we solve this problem? How can we avoid using our hands to turn a page?"</em> and the idea for Muv√Øc was born.

We came together as four individuals, passionate about sound, music, and digital-audio. We developed Muv√Øc in less than 36 hours! This beautiful web-application that uses face-recognition algorithms to scan for facial cues and turn the music sheets at the appropriate moment.

<h2> üí™ How It Works </h2>
<p>
Muv√Øc lets a user select a pdf of sheet music from their account collection. What if a user wants more sheet music in their collection? Muv√Øc lets a user upload their own PDFs or explore sheet music available for download from the shop. 

Once a user has selected a piece to play Muv√Øc will ask for access to the device's camera. Once Muv√Øc recognizes a user's face, they will be able to use facial cues to move through the music sheets. It only takes an eyebrow raise to move forward. 

Alternatively, users have the option to play with a measure tracker and a metronome to move at the same rate the song is supposed to be played. 

You play, Muv√Øc moves.
